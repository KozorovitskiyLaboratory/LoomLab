# LoomLab
Script for reading and plotting Mousebrain.org loom files in Matlab. Please cite https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.05.455317v1 or published manuscript.

This script is currently very hard-coded. However, the script is also very short and fairly straightforward, and the places where you can change values to suit your needs are (hopefully) well commented!
